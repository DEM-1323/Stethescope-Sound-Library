# Stethoscope Sound Library - User Guide

## Introduction

The Stethoscope Sound Library is an educational tool designed to help nursing students learn and practice identifying various stethoscope sounds. This guide will help you navigate and use the application in both standalone mode and with the custom Bluetooth-enabled stethoscope.

## Basic Application Usage

### Accessing the Library

When you first open the application in your web browser, you will see the UMB logo and Center for Clinical Education & Research header. The main interface is divided into three sections: Library Selection on the left, Audio Files on the right, and the Audio Player at the bottom.

### Navigating the Content

The Library Selection panel displays available categories of sounds. Select a category by tapping it, and the Audio Files panel will update to show the available recordings. Each audio file displays its name and duration. The currently selected category and file will be highlighted in yellow for easy reference.

### Using the Audio Player

The audio player provides comprehensive playback controls. The large central button toggles play and pause. Below it, you'll find additional controls including previous track, next track, and a repeat mode toggle. The progress bar allows you to seek to different parts of the recording, and the time display shows both elapsed and total time.

## Using the Bluetooth Stethoscope

### Connecting the Device

1. Prepare the Stethoscope
   Start by ensuring the bluetooth speaker inside stethoscope is charged and powered on.

2. Unscrew the bottom of the stethoscope bell housing and place Bluetooth speaker
   inside with the speaker side facing down .

3. In your device settings, navigate to Bluetooth and ensure that Bluetooth is enabled.

4. Look for a device named “UMB-Stethoscope” in your Bluetooth settings. Select it to initiate pairing.
   When prompted, confirm the pairing request. The speakers LED indicator will change from blinking to solid blue when successfully connected.

### Using the Connected Stethoscope

Once paired, the stethoscope integrates seamlessly with the application's audio playback. The audio will play through the stethoscope rather than your device's speakers, providing a more authentic learning experience.

When using the connected stethoscope:

- The volume can be adjusted using the physical volume buttons on your device
- The stethoscope will maintain its connection until powered off or moved out of range

### Troubleshooting Bluetooth Connection

If you experience connection issues:

1. Ensure the bluetooth speaker inside the stethoscope is charged and powered on
2. Try turning the bluetooth speaker inside the stethoscope off and on again
3. Disable and re-enable Bluetooth on your device
4. If problems persist, unpair the device and repeat the pairing process
5. Check that no other devices are currently paired to the stethoscope

## Best Practices

### Optimal Learning Experience

For the best learning experience, we recommend:

1. Using headphones or the Bluetooth stethoscope rather than device speakers
2. Starting with normal heart sounds before progressing to abnormal sounds
3. Using the repeat function to focus on specific sound characteristics
4. Taking advantage of the progress bar to study specific portions of sounds

### Device Care

To maintain the Bluetooth stethoscope:

1. Charge fully before each use
2. Avoid dropping or rough handling

### Educational Environment

The application works best when:

1. Used in a quiet environment
2. Paired with relevant coursework or instruction
3. Used consistently as part of a structured learning plan
4. Combined with physical examination practice
